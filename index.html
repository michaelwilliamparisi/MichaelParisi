                <h2 class="title2">Profile</h2>
                <p>My early educational career and interests moved me into a path of musical fine arts. Becoming heavily invested in my secondary schools music program, I connected with many of the department leading staff, quickly becoming experienced in the operations of performance set-ups and tear-downs while managing my educational studies.

                    At this point in my career my intention was to explore a higher education in the musical arts.
                    
                    These years were not so straight forward as my alma mater was subject to strikes of varying kinds. With things being in a constant range of flux, I took this time to pursue an understanding of teaching within the industry. Graduating, I felt it best to develop an understanding of the business of music which lead me to review opportunities in the cruise industry (pre-pandemic) and in engineering/recording.
                    
                    It took some time to develop this understanding and peeling away these layers of exploration, my place in the industry was not as clearly defined as I felt comfortable with.
                    
                    Looking back at my career to date, I needed to take some time to sit back and really evaluate the future I wanted to create for myself.
                    
                    With odd jobs here and there, I used this time to analyze current market opportunities and future career objectives; with available time spent working on equivalency classes and bettering my baseline knowledge.
                    
                    Classes varied in content, with such classes including but not limited to;
                    
                    · Mathematics
                    
                    · Coding
                    
                    · Business
                    
                    My current objectives are in the field of computer science, data management and software development.
                    
                    I’m currently developing an online resume that will best represent projects currently under development.
                    
                    Looking forward to things to come.
                    
                    During the pandemic I enrolled in coding classes to begin familiarizing myself with code languages before I began my first semester at Durham College for their Computer Programming and Analysis advanced diploma program.
